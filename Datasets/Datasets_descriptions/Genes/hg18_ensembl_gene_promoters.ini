datasetDescription = Gene promoter regions contain a large number of gene-regulatory elements and play a key role in the control of transcription initiation. Promoter locations were calculated from Ensembl gene annotation data (<a href="http://may2009.archive.ensembl.org/biomart/martview" target="_blank">link</a>, <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=hg18&hgta_group=genes&hgta_track=ensGene&hgta_table=ensGene&hgta_doSchema=describe+table+schema" target="_blank">link</a>), namely as the genomic region ranging from 5 kilobases upstream to 1 kilobase downstream of the annotated transcription start site.
