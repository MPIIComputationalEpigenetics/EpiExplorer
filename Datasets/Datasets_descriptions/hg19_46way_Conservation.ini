datasetDescription = This track shows predictions of conserved elements produced by the phastCons program based on a whole-genome alignment of vertebrates, and for the placental mammal subset of species in the alignment. They are based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM), a type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA substitution at each site in a genome and the way this process changes from one site to the next.
