datasetDescription = This track was created by using Arian Smit's RepeatMasker program, which screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The program outputs a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence (represented by this track), as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked (generally available on the Downloads page). RepeatMasker uses the RepBase library of repeats from the Genetic Information Research Institute (GIRI). RepBase is described in Jurka, J. (2000) in the References section below.
