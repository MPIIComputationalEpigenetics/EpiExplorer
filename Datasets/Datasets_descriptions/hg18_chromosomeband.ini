datasetDescription = The chromosome band track represents the approximate location of bands seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes. Chromosomes are displayed in the browser with the short arm first. Cytologically identified bands on the chromosome are numbered outward from the centromere on the short (p) and long (q) arms. At low resolution, bands are classified using the nomenclature [chromosome][arm][band], where band is a single digit. Examples of bands on chromosome 3 include 3p2, 3p1, cen, 3q1, and 3q2. At a finer resolution, some of the bands are subdivided into sub-bands, adding a second digit to the band number, e.g. 3p26. This resolution produces about 500 bands. A final subdivision into a total of 862 sub-bands is made by adding a period and another digit to the band, resulting in 3p26.3, 3p26.2, etc.
