datasetDescription = This track was created by using a more recent version (3.2.7, Jan. 2009) of Arian Smit's RepeatMasker program, which screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The program outputs a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence, as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked.
