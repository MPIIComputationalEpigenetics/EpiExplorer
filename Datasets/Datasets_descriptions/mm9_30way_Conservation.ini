datasetDescription = This track shows multiple alignments of 30 vertebrate species and measurements of evolutionary conservation using two methods (phastCons and phyloP) from the PHAST package, for all species (vertebrate) and two subsets (euarchontoglire and placental mammal). The multiple alignments were generated using multiz and other tools in the UCSC/Penn State Bioinformatics comparative genomics alignment pipeline. Conserved elements identified by phastCons are also displayed in this track. The species are divided into three different groups. The euarchontoglires subset (10 species plus mouse), the placental mammal subset (19 species plus mouse), and all 30 vertebrate species together. These three measurements produce the same results in regions where only euarchontoglires appear in the alignment. For other regions, the non-euarchontoglires species can either boost the scores (if conserved) or decrease them (if non-conserved). The placental mammal conservation helps to identify sequences that are under different evolutionary pressures in mammals and non-mammal vertebrates.
