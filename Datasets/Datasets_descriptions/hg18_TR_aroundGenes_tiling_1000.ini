### Description: Take all gene regions and extract a shore around them of +50k ,-50k
### 			 merge the annotations and make a tiling with 1kb,2kb,5kb,10kb	
### CB: I guess: 2kb, 5kb, 10kb, 100kb. 
###     1kb would also be good, but may give rise to too many regions.
###     I'd also suggest that you drop the partial overlap between neighboring tiles, i.e. always set size == step.

datasetDescription = This track was created by extending the areas around genes with 100kb downstream and upstream. The overlapping regions were merged and via using a sliding window of size 1000bp and shifting it by 500bp a set of regions were obtained. They were fully annotated with all CGS properties.
